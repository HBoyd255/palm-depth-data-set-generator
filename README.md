# Palm Depth Data Set Generator

This is the code used for capturing the Palm Depth Data Set.

## Testing Plan

1. Set cameras 32mm apart.

2. Calibrate camera alignment using a print out of the
   [Calibration sheet](Calibration/CameraAlignmentCalibrationSheet.svg).

3. Capture stereoscopic images at 30cm intervals, from 30cm to 300cm.

4. Repeat step 3 twice more.

5. Repeat steps 1 - 4 for camera spacings of 40mm to 96mm at 8mm intervals.

The result should be 270 labeled stereoscopic images taken over a range of
distances and camera spacings.
